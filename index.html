    	<h3>Computer</h3>
    	<p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia:</p>
    	<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">
    	A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

It typically has a touchscreen interface, allowing users to access a wide range of applications and services, such as web browsing, email, and social media, as well as multimedia playback and streaming.

      <h3>Coffee</h3>
    	<p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia:</p>
    	<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">
    	Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.

      <h2>The downsides of computer, smartphone and coffee</h2>
      <h3><b>Computer:</b></h3>
      <p>Repetitive strain injuries: Spending long hours hunched over a computer can lead to pain and discomfort in your neck, back, and wrists.<br>
      Eye strain: Staring at a screen for extended periods can cause eye fatigue, dryness, and headaches.<br>
      Sleep disruption: The blue light emitted by computer screens can interfere with your sleep cycle, making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep.<br>
      Social isolation: While computers can connect you to others, overuse can lead to neglecting in-person interactions and social isolation.</p>
      <h3><b>Smartphone:</b></h3>
      <p>Addiction: Smartphones are designed to be addictive, with constant notifications and social media updates that keep you glued to the screen.<br>
      Distraction: Smartphones can be a major distraction, making it difficult to focus on work, school, or even conversations with others.<br>
      Neck and back pain: Looking down at your phone for long periods can strain your neck and back muscles.<br>
      Sleep disruption: Similar to computers, the blue light emitted by smartphones can disrupt your sleep.</p>
      <h3><b>Coffee:</b></h3>
      <p>Anxiety and insomnia: Coffee is a stimulant, and too much can lead to anxiety, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping.<br>
      Digestive issues: Coffee can irritate the stomach and intestines, leading to heartburn, indigestion, and diarrhea.<br>
